          <p>TRPCo. was founded in 2008, at the height of the global recession, by Johnathan Carter. Then 82, Carter was a lively man who had been well known for accumulating a number of passions that always came to fruition. For instance, he invented a machine that puts the little tips of plastic on sneakers automatically. He also is the world record holder for most M&M's stuck in a single nostril. Carter thought he would try his hand at business, in the one industry he knew very much about. Paper. Carter was raised by a 2 post it notes. Talk about born for the job!
